# little-shop-bulk-discounts

In this Solo project, students were given the task of creating a Bulk Discount extension on to our Little Esty Shop group project. 
I added functionality for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items, based on the quantity of items the customer is buying.
Little Esty is our fictitious e-commerce platform, that narrowly escapes copyright infringement of "that one site"; but hey, we did it!
